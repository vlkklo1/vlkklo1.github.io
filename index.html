<div data-v-1e8d9f52=""><strong>Las Vegas tourism</strong> officials say the spike is a sign of improved conditions in the valley.<br><br>The city's tourism association, which hosts a "Vegas Spirit Guide" for visitors to the Valley, says the number of visitors this summer "remains above the highest it's been in years."<br><br>But, city spokeswoman Monica Johnson says, it's not always so, as visitors are now often delayed by bad weather.<br><br>"It does make it difficult for businesses, families, and families that have moved down here for summer vacations," she said<br><br>The number of tourists in July 2014 also "saw a significant decrease" compared to the July 2013, Johnson said. July 2013 peaked at more than 9 million visitors, while in July 2014, it reached about 7.4 million.<br><br>"It's a result of people coming home from overseas, taking in the resorts here in Las Vegas," Johnson said. "It's just not a good time to go, so we've had fewer visitors during the holiday season."<br><br>More visitors mean more revenue for local hotel and restaurant</div>
